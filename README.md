<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the reimplementation of GOTURN in PyTorch.
If you are interested in the following, you should consider using this
repository

* Understand different moving parts of the GOTURN algorithm,
independently through code. 

* Plug and play with different parts of the pipeline such as data, network, optimizers, cost functions.

* Built with following frameworks:
	- [PyTorch-Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)
	- [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom)
